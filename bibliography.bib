	abstract = {We trained a neural network model to predict Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) Used Nuclear Fuel (UNF) composition given initial enrichment and burnup. This quick, flexible, medium-fidelity method to estimate depleted PWR fuel assembly compositions is used to model scenarios in which the PWR fuel burnup and enrichment vary over time. The Used Nuclear Fuel Storage, Transportation \& Disposal Analysis Resource and Data System (UNF-ST\&DARDS) Unified Database (UDB) provided a ground truth on which the model trained. We validated the model by comparing the U.S. UNF inventory profile predicted by the model with the UDB UNF inventory profile. The neural network yields less than 1\% error for UNF inventory decay heat and activity and less than 2\% error for major isotopic inventory. The neural network model takes 0.27 s for 100 predictions, compared to 118 s for 100 Oak Ridge Isotope GENeration (ORIGEN) calculations. We also implemented this model into Cyclus, an agent-based Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) simulator, to perform rapid, medium-fidelity PWR depletion calculations. This model also allows discharge of batches with assemblies of varying burnup. Since the original private data cannot be retrieved from the model, this trained model can provide open-source depletion capabilities to NFC simulators. We show that training an artificial neural network with a dataset from a complex fuel depletion model can provide rapid, medium-fidelity depletion capabilities to large-scale fuel cycle simulations.},

To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

An important part of UNF-ST\&DARDS is the Unified Database (UDB), which contains information that can support a variety of activities including fuel storage, fuel transportation, and disposal-related system analysis. Currently, the main application of the UDB is to support evaluation of the characteristics of discharged spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from the U.S. commercial reactors. However, because of the extensive amount of data that has been collected and analyzed for UNFST\&DARDS, there are many more applications that can utilize the UDB including system analysis with the Next-Generation System Analysis Model (NGSAM) and fuel cycle analysis with fuel cycle simulation codes such as ORION. Going forward, NGSAM and fuel cycle transition analysis with ORION integrate UDB data wherever possible in the UDB’s development plan. These advances in NGSAM and fuel cycle analysis can be used in conjunction with the UDB to help answer more complex questions about the optimization, utilization, storage, and eventual disposal of SNF.},

	abstract = {The United States inventory of the spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is {\textasciitilde}80,000 metric tons of heavy metal (MTHM) at the end of 2018, which contains {\textasciitilde}131 tons of minor actinides (MAs) and {\textasciitilde}669 tons of plutonium. This paper describes a conceptual design of an accelerator-driven subcritical (ADS) system for disposing of this SNF inventory by utilizing the 131 tons of MAs inventory and a fraction of the plutonium inventory for energy production and transmuting some long-lived fission products. An ADS system with a homogeneous subcritical fission blanket was first examined to define the main system parameters. A spallation neutron source is used to drive the fission blanket and it is generated from the interaction of a 1-GeV proton beam with a lead–bismuth eutectic (LBE) target. The fission blanket has a liquid mobile fuel using LBE as the fuel carrier. The fuel materials are dissolved, mixed, or suspended in the liquid fuel carrier. Monte Carlo simulations were performed for three fission blankets to determine the main concept parameters. The loaded amount of actinide materials in the LBE carrier is either 5, 7, or 10\% of the total volume of the fission blanket, respectively. The plutonium fraction in the MAs of each fission blanket was selected so that the neutron multiplication factors of the three fission blankets are {\textasciitilde}0.980. In addition, Monte Carlo burnup simulations using the MCB5 computer program were performed to analyze the performance of the three conceptual ADS systems. During operation, fresh fuel is fed into the fission blankets to adjust its subcriticality and to control the system power. The burnup results show that the total MA materials consumed are about 30.6, 35.3, and 37.2 tons, after operating the three fission blankets for 35 full-power years with 25-MW 1-GeV proton beam. Thus, the corresponding numbers of ADS systems to utilize the 131 tons of MA materials of the SNF inventory are 4.3, 3.7, or 3.5, respectively. ADS systems with tube bundles inserted in the fission blanket were analyzed to overcome the disadvantages of the homogeneous fission blanket concept. The liquid lead is used as the target material, the mobile fuel carrier, and the primary coolant to avoid the polonium production from bismuth. Physics and thermal–hydraulic analyses were coupled to determine the parameters of the heterogeneous fission blanket. The engineering requirements for a satisfactory performance of the HT-9 ferritic steel structure material have been realized. Two heterogeneous fission blanket concepts with the liquid lead mobile fuel inside or outside the tube bundles were considered. The heterogeneous fission blanket with the mobile fuel inside the tubes shows better performance than the fission blanket with mobile fuel outside the bundle tubes and it is presented in this paper. MCB5 and Serpent, the Monte Carlo burnup computer programs were both used to simulate the fuel burnup in the ADS concept with the mobile fuels inside the tubes for 35 full power years. The results show that five ADS systems can dispose of the total United States inventory of the spent nuclear fuel.},

	abstract = {A technical assessment of the current inventory [∼70,150 metric tons of heavy metal (MTHM) as of 2011] of U.S.-discharged used nuclear fuel (UNF) has been performed to support decisions regarding fuel cycle strategies and research, development and demonstration (RD and D) needs. The assessment considered discharged UNF from commercial nuclear electricity generation and defense and research programs and determined that the current UNF inventory can be divided into the following three categories: 1. Disposal - excess material that is not needed for other purposes; 2. Research - material needed for RD and D purposes to support waste management (e.g., UNF storage, transportation, and disposal) and development of alternative fuel cycles (e.g., separations and advanced fuels/reactors); and 3. Recycle/Recovery - material with inherent and/or strategic value. A set of key assumptions and attributes relative to the various disposition options were used to categorize the current UNF inventory. Based on consideration of RD and D needs, time frames and material needs for deployment of alternative fuel cycles, characteristics of the current UNF inventory, and possible uses to support national security interests, it was determined that the vast majority of the current UNF inventory should be placed in the Disposal category, without the need to make fuel retrievable from disposal for reuse or research purposes. Access to the material in the Research and Recycle/Recovery categories should be retained to support RD and D needs and national security interests. This assessment does not assume any decision about future fuel cycle options or preclude any potential options, including those with potential recycling of commercial UNF. (authors)},

It is designed in such a way as to couple the different components of an ADS in a realistic environment by using an existing critical reactor adapted to the experiment’s objectives, at significant power levels. This paper summarises the neutronic characterisation of the system, an essential step in the design and licensing process. The feasibility of the experiment is demonstrated, establishing the sub-criticality levels of operation and fuel rod configurations. The analyses of the neutron distribution in space, energy and time detail the behaviour of a real-power thermal ADS and identify the extent and limitations for the experimental programme. Studies investigating the potential of such a system to transmute transuranics and long-lived fission fragments demonstrate the need to move to fast neutron systems in order to efficiently transmute these major components of nuclear waste.},
